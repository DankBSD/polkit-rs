# polkit-rs

[gir](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir)-generated Rust bindings for [polkit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/)
libraries `libpolkit-gobject-1` and `libpolkit-agent-1`.

Currently no bindings for the subclassable agent class, just use dbus manually to listen on the agent interface.
